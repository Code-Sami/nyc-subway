# How long should we wait before refreshing MTA feed? MTA says feeds are
# generated every 30 seconds, so anything less wouldn't make sense.
# Feed size (from each pull) can be around 500 kiB. Therefore expect to pull
# around 350 MiB in a 24 hour period.
# On a RaspPi Zero, expect a turn-around of retrieving and processing data
# to be around 15 seconds.
